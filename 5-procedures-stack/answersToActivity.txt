Talk with your table about how this objecct dump compares to the C source. Document your observations in a text file.

the instructions look very different than in a .s file.
multstore starts from line 107, before this, there are a lot of functions
such as init, start, plt, etc that i dont understand
Once these other functions or methods complete setup, then
multstore is called. 
The code works such that main is where it starts, then multstore
is called from mstore, which in turn calls mult2 from main. In 
the assembly, we see the code for multstore written first,
then mult2, then main.
After the code runs, there are some other functions/methods at the
bottom that seem to round up and end the program, similar to the ones that
do setup!
